This repository contains code examples of [JUnit 5] for the book [Mastering JUnit 5], authored by [Boni Garcia] and published by [Packt]. These examples covers the main features of JUnit 5, containing:

* JUnit 5 tests lifecycle
* Assertions
* Tagging and filtering tests
* Conditional test execution
* Nested and repeated tests
* Migration from JUnit 4
* Dependency injection
* Dynamic tests
* Test interfaces
* Test templates
* Parameterized tests

Moreover, the integration with third-party frameworks and technologies is also illustrated with examples, concretely:

* Mockito (popular mock framework)
* Spring (Java framework aimed to created enterprise applications based on dependency injection)
* Docker (container platform technology)
* Selenium (test framework for web applications)
* Appium (driver for mobile devices)
* Android (open source mobile operating system based on Linux)
* REST services (using REST Assured, Retrofit2, or WireMock)
